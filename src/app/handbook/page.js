        You can reach the US one month before the date given on your I-20 that
        is the latest you&apos;re required to show up. Ideally, you should reach
        here 3-4 days before your first orientation. LAX (Los Angeles
        International Airport) is the closest international airport to
        Riverside, where flights from India land. Riverside is about 60-70 miles
        from there. The best way to reach Riverside from LAX is by shuttle. The
        most reliable (but might not be the cheapest) shuttle service is{" "}

        . You can look up other services on Google. Normal rates from LAX to
        Riverside are $50-75. You&apos;d need an address to reach to while
        registering the shuttle (you can also get one from outside the airport
        even if you haven&apos;t preregistered). Because of the larger presence
        of the Indian community at University Hills Apartments and Highlander
        Park Apartments, chances are that you&apos;re most likely to be put up
        at either of the two for temporary accomodation. The addresses for those
        places are 160 W Big Springs Rd, Riverside, CA 92507 and 3131 Watkins
        Dr, Riverside, CA 92507 respectively.
        <Subtitle text="Medical Tests" />
        UCR requires incoming students from India to only take the Tuberculosis
        test. MMR is strictly optional, unless you&apos;re under 18. You can
        either take the test in India itself, or after coming here (costs a
        miserly amount); it doesn&apos;t really matter. Make sure whichever is
        the case you do submit your medical forms before the deadline specified
        by the{" "}

        , or there might be unnecessary hassle while registering for classes.
        <Subtitle text="Insurance" />
        Most people who get into UCR get fellowships, which would mean that
        health insurance would be covered by the university (unless it is not
        specified). However, this insurance starts only once you register for
        classes. If you plan on reaching Riverside a few weeks before classes
        start, you&apos;re better off getting a travel/health plan from India
        valid for 1-2 months.
        <Subtitle text="Driving Permit" />
        California laws allow us to drive around in a rental car, if we have an
        Indian driver&apos;s license or an international driving permit.
        However, insurance in this case is an issue. Most students can get a
        California driver&apos;s license within a matter of months anyways from
        the{" "}

        , if they are able to get a social security number (you can get one if
        you&apos;re working on campus - includes TA/GSR).
        <Subtitle text="Fellowships" />
        As mentioned before, most incoming students at UCR get a fellowship,
        especially if coming for a PhD. Fellowships usually constitute a
        stipend, fee waiver, TA and/or GSR. Stipends are non-taxable for Indian
        students. TA and GSR however, are taxable. You&apos;re likely to pay
        10-15% of your salary as taxes.
        <Subtitle text="Housing" />
        There are lots of apartments around campus where you could live at. The
        most famous among the Indian community, however, are: University Hills
        Apartments (Ph: 951-683-3650), University Village Apartments (Ph:
        951-684-6828), Highlander Park Apartments (Ph: 951-683-1422) and
        Windwood Apartments (Ph: 951-787-6263).{" "}

        (Bannockburn Village & Plaza, Stonehaven and Family Housing) are also
        preferred by many. You can look up other apartments in the area by
        searching &quot;92507&quot; as the ZIP code, on any apartment rentals

        , which has an excellent listing for the UCR surronding area ZIP 92507).
        The rent for a 1BHK (bedroom-hall-kitchen) apartment is usually between
        $800-1000, while that for a 2BHK apartment is between $1000-1300. There
        are two Indian stores (cum food joint) located within a 15-30 minutes
        walking distance of any of the apartments mentioned above. It is best,
        however, to not decide anything advance, and select an apartment only
        after you get here.
        <Subtitle text="Stuff to Bring" />
        The important thing to realize is that you&apos;re coming to another
        city in the world. You&apos;re not going to an alien planet. Whatever
        supplies you bring should be in a quantity that would help you only for
        the start-up. Everything is available here. And if you&apos;ve a
        fellowship, UCR pays enough money for you to afford them.
